# Thinking about monospace coding fonts

My top five coding fonts would be

1. SF Mono
2. JetBrains Mono
3. Hack
4. Fira Code
5. Source Code Pro

but I am always playing around and switching them. 

For font settings, I prefer not using ligatures. For me, they seem very confusing sometimes. 
I prefer fonts to be big enough to read from an arms length away, but no bigger.
