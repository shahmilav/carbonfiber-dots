## Documenation

### Wallpaper
The wallpaper is the [Pro Display XDR](https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/xdr) wallpaper by BasicAppleGuy. More versions of the wallpaper are available [here](https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/xdr), in HEIC and JPG formats. 

### iTerm2
The iTerm2 config can be found [here](./iterm2/CarbonfiberProfile.json).
The font used in iTerm2 is _IBM Plex Mono Light_
The colorscheme used is a personal port of the [Modus Vivendi](https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes) theme from Emacs. It can be downloaded [here]().

### Neovim
The neovim config is [Nyoom.nvim](https://github.com/shaunsingh/nyoom.nvim).
The colorscheme used is the Nyoom default, [oxocarbon.nvim](https://github.com/shaunsingh/oxocarbon.nvim). In my opinion, it looks _beautiful_.

## Credits

* Thanks to [shaunsingh](https://github.com/shaunsingh) for Nyoom.nvim and oxocarbon.nvim! An amazing config and a beautiful theme.
* George Nachman for developing iTerm2. The best macOS terminal, and I don't think I'll ever switch.
