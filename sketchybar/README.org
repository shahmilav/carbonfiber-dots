#+title: Sketchybar config

This is my very basic [[https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/][SketchyBar]] configuration.
It is minimal and close to the default while still being pretty and functional.

** Features
- Toggle appearance using ~osascript~
- Wifi dropdown with SSID and speed
- Battery level
- Date and time
- Spaces
- Window title
- Native look using SF Symbols and the SF Mono font.
